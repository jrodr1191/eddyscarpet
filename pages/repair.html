                    <p>We don't only focus on installing new floors, and make sure to put the save love and quality into 
                        our repairs as the rest of our work. Having luxury vinyl or unique and expressive carpets that extend
                        across a room can be a make or break that helps tie everything else together. With that said, having 
                        such flooring for extended amounts of time and across large spaces eventually causes build up that 
                        may cause damages to said flooring, ranging from small irreversible scratches to rips and tears in the 
                        fabric itself.

                    <h1>Why Repair?</h1>
                    <p>Replacing flooring is expensive, whether it be to install a new carpet, or just have simplistic tile or 
                        vinyl replace your current floors. Occasionally, someone might want to keep an old carpet, but because 
                        of some wear and tear in certain areas, they might feel the need to give it attention and finally do something 
                        about it. Our flooring repair services aim to not only fix problem areas in the floor, but to hopefully give the feel 
                        of a completely new floor at a fraction of the price. We specialize in carpet repair, but also work with repairing tile,
                        vinyl, laminate, and more. Call or email us today to find out how we can be of service to you!
